* Curent
** Evaluation
   - (x) Get node pos/target

   - ( ) Updates to state/pos should update insertion instead of re-inserting
   - ( ) Updates to pos should update previous insertion (track pos)
** Backend
   - (x) user/pass Authentication
   - (x) Note short id (unique workspace+note)
   - (x) Note referenced as `@workspace-slug/note-name`
   - ( ) Create note
   - ( ) Create workspace
   - ( ) Signup
   - ( ) Note content integration: y.js document storage + retrieval via http
** Others
   - (x) Collapsable code blocks
   - ( ) Prevent re-creating view on update for code block
   - ( ) Routing
   - ( ) Workspace list page
   - ( ) Notes list page
   - ( ) Note view
   - ( ) Testing api with test containers

* Bugs
  - (x) Fix issue with state initialization in code blocks
  - (x) Fix memory leak with inline code
  - ( ) Fix issue with inline buttons needing 2 clicks sometimes
  - ( ) Debug random freezes / cpu spikes
  - ( ) Fix memory leak

* Later
** Evaluation
   - ( ) Promise/async code eval
   - ( ) If export (or inline func) has args, ask user for input?
   - ( ) Save state in the document?
** Modules
   - ( ) Allow `import`-ing other notes (provide state/behavior + exports?)
   - ( ) Button next to import stmnt to open imported note
** Capabilities
   - ( ) Permission based capabilities (Ask user if a feature can be used)
   - ( ) Don't show permission request if user is the author
   - ( ) feat: fetch. Allow fetching data. (Ask for permission per host)
   - ( ) Keybindings
   - ( ) Embeds?
** Backend
   - ( ) github oauth
   - ( ) For imports, can only import note if note is in same workspace or is public
   - ( ) confirm email (+ sendgrid)
** Infra
   - ( ) Infra setup for api (ovhcloud? | digitalocean? | aws?)
   - ( ) Postgres DB setup (neon? | ovhcloud?)
** Collaboration
   - ( ) invite to workspace/workspace collaborators
   - ( ) hocuspocus or y-websocket server for realtime?
   - ( ) multi-user collaboration/multi-cursor features
   - ( ) Tagging users
** Other
   - ( ) freeze `internal`
   - ( ) cleanup all signals/effects when exiting the editor

* Supported features/ideas
  - ( ) Note based calculator
  - ( ) Simplified canvas api for drawing
  - ( ) Task management
  - ( ) Datetime picker
  - ( ) Fetch and present external data
  - ( ) Draft and send custom emails (mail client)?
  - ( ) Email reminders for tasks?
  - ( ) Read section of page
  - ( ) Make requests to openai (how to manage secrets?)

* Improvements
  - ( ) Improve markdown editing experience
  - ( ) Truncate the inline result decoration
  - ( ) Debounce evaluation checks

* Maybe
  - ( ) Slash commands
  - ( ) Block-ey UI with drag and drop
  - ( ) Support images with image upload
  - ( ) Debug view for showing current state
  - ( ) Print to PDF (including results)
  - ( ) Consider giving up markdown?
  - ( ) Importing js from CDN? (naah)

* Done
** Evaluation
   - (x) Use quickjs for runtime
   - (x) Evaluate code blocks
   - (x) Exports as buttons
   - (x) Use signals for evaluation
   - (x) Evaluate on signal and edit to code node (or just the doc if I'm lazy)
   - (x) Fix issue with solidjs root
   - (x) Inline code is button if returning function
** Backend
   - (x) API setup
   - (x) workspace->notes api
** Improvements
  - (x) Value/Error distinction in result decoration
